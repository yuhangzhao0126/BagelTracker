Now help me to add a new feature to my website.
After a user log in successfully. He have a box in dashboard to search all existing users. And this box has string matching function. It will give him all results  with the prefix user typed and he could choose one. For example, if he type "user", it will give him all matching results start with the prefix "user", like "user1", "user2"... If there are more than 5 results, only show the top 5.
